## What is this?
Have you ever lost your Minecraft world before?

Maybe your hard drive died. Maybe you used a server hosting service that terminated without warning. Maybe you just accidentally deleted it.

DriveBackupV2 is a plugin that aims to provide an extra layer of security to your data by backing it up remotely.

## Features
- Creates and/or uploads backups to Google Drive, OneDrive, or a remote (S)FTP server
- Can create a backup out of any files or folders on your Minecraft server
- Can include files and MySQL databases from external servers (such as a BungeeCord one!)
- Deletes backups locally and remotely if they exceed a specified amount
- Can automatically run backups at an interval or on a schedule
- And **much** more!

## Privacy Policy
Since we need to access your Google Drive and/or OneDrive data to back up your world, we are required to provide a Privacy Policy.
 
All of the data this plugin uploads and downloads from your Google Drive and/or OneDrive stays on your Minecraft server, so we never have access to it. This plugin physically cannot access any data in your Google Drive and/or OneDrive that is not related to backing up your Minecraft world backups. But don't take our word for it, all of this plugin's source code is available here!
